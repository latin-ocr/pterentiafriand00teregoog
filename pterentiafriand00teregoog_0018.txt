Tur debt of Latin to Greek literature is nowhere more
clearly seen than in eomedy. Like every other form of
poetry, excepting satire, which the Romans claimed as en·
tirely their own (satira tota nostra eet ,· Quintilian, X. 1),
the comic drama native to the soil of Italy was stimulated
into a true literary life only by contact with the almost
faultless models of the Greeks. Before this period of con-
tect, which began about the end of the first Punic war
(241 a.c.), the Romans had no literature worth the name.
Certain rude and unpromising beginnings of eomedy existed
in scattered local forms. Among these were the Fescen-
nine verses, named from the village of Fescennium in Etru·
ria They were originally popular harvestsongs, and were
arranged in responsive form, perhaps in alternate verses.
Their poetic and literary character was of the rudest type,
and their wit was the coarse bantering give-and-take of coun-
try louts in the harvest field. Other varieties were the cataro,
a merry medley sung (perhaps by masked performers) at
festivals in the country, and the mima or pantomimic farce.
A better kind of performance was the fabula Atellano,
named from Atella, a town of the Oscans in Campania.
This contained some elcments of a formal play, and was
rendered by a set of volunteer masked actors who were
young men of patrician families. The play consisted of

· “comic descriptions of life in small towns, in which the chief

personages gradually assumed a fixed character.’' * No pro-
