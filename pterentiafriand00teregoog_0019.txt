ary form than the other early dramatic attempta, because it
was largely composed in Saturnian metre. This verse, though
admitting of much freedom and irregularity, is substantially
a trochaic measure of six feet preceded by a starting syllable.
An example which will serve to represent itin English is

“The Ι queen was tu her perlor etting bread and honey.”
In Latin,

It is easy to see how the existence of this as the sole native
metre among the Romans would prepare the way for natural·
izing first of all such versificatione of the Greeks as most
closely resembled the Saturnian. These were the trochaic
metres and their complement, the iambic, the two standard
measures of Greek comedy. Later, when Greek influencc
had succceded in moulding the Latin matres, the Saturnian
was considered a kind of iambic or trochaic verse.

From such elements as these there was but little prospect
of the outgrowth of a high order of comic ‘drama 'she lan-
guage ol the Romans was as yet imperfectly developed, their
rhythms were confined to the careless Saturnian verse, their
social life was still comparatively simple and unpolished‚
and their minds were naturally practical and little inclined
to a leisurely cultivationof letters. In such astate of affairs
the influence of the Greeks began to make its way towards
Rome and revealed to the Italians, hitherto unversed in art
and literature, the masterworks of a civilitation which had
been refined for generations. Among these were the plays of
the New Comedy of Athens, the latest and in some respects
the highest works of Greek comedy.
