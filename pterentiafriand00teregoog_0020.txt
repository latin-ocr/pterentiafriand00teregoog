INTRODUCTION. ‘lx

from au early date, as in tho Sicilian comedy, of which Epi·
charmus was the most noted writer, its principal develop-
ment was among the Athenians, with whom it passed through
three stages, named respectively tho Old, the Middle, and the
New Comedy. ,

llhe Old Comedy lasted for somewhat less than two cen-
turias, probably until about 375 aa, a generation later than
the close of the Peloponnesian war in 404 nc. Its most
flourishing time was at the culmination of tho political influ-
ence oi Athens. Its greatest representative was Aristoph-
anes, and its spirit was directly personal and political. Real
persons were portrayed under real names, and its fearless
references to men and events invested it with the charac-

has full play here. It is untrammelled and unconstrained
both in its internal ideas and its public privileges Its tone
varies'and shifts so as to reproduce any phase of political
or private life at will, and veers bach and forth with the ut-
most freedom from high patriotic sentiment clothed in ex-
quisite poetic grace to the other extrema of grossness and
scurrility.

Next came Middle Comedy, soon after the Peloponnesian
war, and continued through the transition age which ended
with the overthrow of Greek liberty, by Philip of Macedon,
about 330 ac. It is itself a transition from the Old to the
New Comedy. Its features are not always easy to define.
instead of the sharp, direct portrayal of individual men and
actual events, we meet with fictitious names and the. descrip-
tion of men by the types or classes to which they belong.
Greater care seems to have been bestowed upon the elabora-
tion of the plot and in general a departure is, made from the
extravagance and openly personal style of the former comedy
towards more abstract literary ideals. The logical and his-
torical outcome of the first two periods was the New Com-

edy, wherein both persons and names are fictitious, and the
play becomes a delineation of human nature in its lighter
