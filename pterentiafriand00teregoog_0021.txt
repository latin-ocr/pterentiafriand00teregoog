pheses. The behavior of the various types of men towards
each other in their domestic aud social relatione, and this
behavior as the means through which we obtain a philo·
sophie glimpse at what men really are, is the subject-matter,
which is treated in a humorous and genial spirit by the
writers of the N ew Comedy. The directness, the rank viril-
ity, and the unrestrained license of the Old Comedy were
not essential, but accidental, to the comio drama.. These dis·
appeared, and with them the Old Oomedy, out of whose ele·
ments of universal velue was developed the New Comedy‚
which is simply the Old refined and led away to abstract
ideals. It is abstract, non-political, refined in style, symmet
rical in form, and delicately philosophical in spirit-the eom·
, edy of character and manners, which was the last finished
product of the Greeks in this directior, and which· also con·
taius ideals to which the greatest comedians of Latin and
modern times, as Plautus, Terence, Shakespeare, and Moliere,
with more or less consciousness of obligation have shaped
their cornio dramas. ’

The chief writers of this period are Menander, Diphilus,
and Philemon, who were contemporary. Philippides, Apol-
lodorus and Posidippus also fiourished about the same time.
Among these the chief place belongs to Menander of Athens
(ala-291 no), because of his general literary superiority,
his fame in antiquity, and his marked influenee both on later
Greek writers, as Alciphron and Lucian, audon the Latin
comedians. Of Terence’s six·plays, four-the “Andria”
“Heauton timorumenos,’' “ Eunuchus,” and “ Adelphos '’—
are modelled on plays of Menander, and these are general-
ly admitted to be, on the whole, superior to the other two
' —the ‘⁴ Hecyra ” and “ Phormio ’'-which arc based on plays

of Apollodorus.

Of the hundred or more plays of Menander not one has
come to us entire. Nothing of what he wrote is now extant,
except what has been saved by quotation iu other writers
