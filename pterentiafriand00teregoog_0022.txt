and by collectione of extracts. In these fragments, which
amount to considerably more than two thousand lines, there
are preserved passages of sufficient length to assure us both
as to his style and spirit. His style is easy and spontaneous,
and oouohed in the language of quiet refinement. His sen-
tenoes read as if they were written but onoe, and then once
for all. They move on in their oourse without break or jar,
unhindered by anything involved or labored or obscure. Free ⁴
from pretentiousness, and unenoumbered by external orna-
mentution‚ their beauty and oharm lie in their clear simplio-
ity. His spirit is in harmony with his style, and runs in
a dehoately philosophioal vein. His philosophy, as seen in
his writings, is drawn from two sources. His analysis of hu-
man nature and of its modes of operation is derived from
Aristotle through Theophrastus. Aristotlo had advanoed be-
yond the maxim of Socrates, γνῶθι σαυτόν, whioh made solf-
observation the instrument of investigating the human mind,
and had given a large place to the supplementary method of
investigating human nature by observing others as well as
one’s sels. The problem in this form is to find what men
are by what they do, and for this the moro instanoes observed
the better. This teaohing of Aristotlo was further elaborated
by his pupil Theophrastus, and may be seen in his “ Charae-
ters,’' a series of sketohes of the leading traits and peouhar-
ities of men. On the groundworh of Aristotle's analysis he
worhs out to fine details portraitures which¹ are illustratione of
his master’s teaohing. Menander earne under the influenoe of
Theophrastus, and thus received both the teaohing of Aris-

totle and its applicatione as wrought out by Theophrastus.
Under the influenoe of these antecedents Menander wrote his
plays, and employed the observation of others as his means
for attaining a truthiul view of what men vere. He has re-
corded a sentiment of this sort in his play “ Thrasyleon :''

κατὰ πόλλ’ ἄρ’ ἐστὶν οὐ καλῶς εἰρημένον
τὸ γνῶθι σαυτόν· χρησιμώτερον γὰρ ἦν
τὸ γνῶθι τοὺς ἄλλους.
