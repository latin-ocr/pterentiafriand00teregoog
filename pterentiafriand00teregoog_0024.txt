INTRODUGTION. xiil

of Horace and Cicero, is nothing, and his importance is due
only to the fact that he rs the pioneer in the series of Latin
¹comedians and fumishes an illustration of the route by which
the influence of Greek comedy travelled to Rome, namely‚
through the southern part of Italy, where there had existed
for centuries a Greek civilization, which received from Athens
what was to be handed over later to Rome.

The principal names in the comoedia palliata,¹ or the Lat·
in comedy derived from the GreekS, are four—Naevius,
Plautus, Caecilius, and Terence. Naevius came to Rome
soon after the first Punic war, in which he had served as a
soldier, and brought out his first play about 235 ac. He was
by birtha Campanian and in all probability a Roman citizen.
He adapted both tragedies and comedies from the Greek,
and attempted to exercise a froedom of comment on publio
men and affairs such as prevailed in the earlier comedy at
Athens. For offences of this nature, and especially for one
directed against the Metelli, one of whom was then consul
and another praetor urbanae, he was arrested and thrown into
prison. He apologized for his defamatory verses by insert-
ing his retractions in two plays, the “Ariolus '’ and “Lea’'
which he wrote while in confinement. The strictly legal pen·
alty for his offcnee was death, but he went into banishment
to Utica, probably because as a citizen he was entitled to take
perpetual exile in place of the death penalty. His death oc·
curred at Utica probably somewhat later than 204 ac. His
treatment by the authorities determined the non-political char-
acter of all subsequent Latin comedy. His style is vigorous
and direct. He is a plebeian of plebeians in his whole atti-
tude. Strong native humor and rough common-sense, coupled
with a firm mastery of the Latin language, are the marks of
his poetry, which remains to us only in the form of scattered
fragmenta. Of his style Cicero says ‘⁶ luculente scripsit.” His

¹ So named from the palliam, a Greek cloak worn by the aetors. There
was also the coanoedia togata, in which the costuma was strictly Roman.
Afranius was its chief poet.
