epitaph claims that after he passed into the realm of Orcus
men at Rome forgot how to speak the Latin tongue:

“ Itaque postquamst Oreine traditus thesauro
Obliti sunt Romae loquier Latina liugua.‘’

He wrote both in Saturnian verse and in the imported
metres of the Greeks.

A younger contemporary of Naevius was Titus Maccius
Plautus (254-184 nc), the greatest of the comio poets of
Rome. Twenty of his plays, besides a considerable num·
ber of fragmenta, have come down 10 us. He was born of
poor parentage at the little town of Sarsina in Umbria As
manager for a company of actors and a stage decorator he
acquired a modest fortune. In consequence of a reckless
disposition of this in bad investments he was suddenly re-
duced to work as a slave iu grinding at the mill. Meanwhile
he managed by writing plays 10 extricate himself from pover-
ty and devoted himself to the comio drama, which he ruled at
Rome for more than a generation in his own lifetime. His
checkered career had made him master of the phases of the
life of the plebs and the slaveS, in the delineation of which
phases his native genius is to be seen most clearly. Although

, the Greek comedians serveas his acknowledged medela, his

treatment of their work is free and careless. They furnished
him the literary and metrical forms by which he was ruled;
but their contents are freely rehandled with the view of suit-
ing his audience. His exuberant and almost riotous style of
humor, his rustic coarseness, and blunt, open fashion of speech
would naturally have led him to reproduce the Old Comedy

rather than the New. But he knew better than 10 attempt
it. The warning of Naevius was before his eyes. He ex-
pressly says in his Persa (Ι. 2. 23-24) that he would be a
fool to comment on public affairs, as they belong properly
to the magistrates:

“Sed sumne ego stultus, qui ram curo publicam,
Vbi sunt magistratus, quos curare oporteat?‘’
