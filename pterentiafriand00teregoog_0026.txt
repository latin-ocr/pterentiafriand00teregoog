Consequently he was shut up to the New Comedy for
his models3 although he made considerable use of Epichar-
mus of Sicily, the strong aud racy flavor of whose plays
was agreeable to his own testes But his literary efforts
were carried ou under the pressure of two great restraintS,
and his impatience under the diversiones his capabilities
from their full aud open play is disceruible iu his style. His
first restraint was, of course, political. Fliugs at the author·
ities, after the manner of Aristophanes, were regarded at Rome
as a form of treasou because they were directed against the
living representatives of the State, and however much his
plebeiau hearers would have applauded his thrusts, his career
as a poet would have been summarily ended. This alone
would have debarred him from the Old Comedy. His sec-
ond restraint was iu the nature of his audiences. The Ro·

we would discover what it would be sure to enjoy, we have
only to glauce at the character of the early native Latin comio
literature. The faree, the pantomime‚ the broad johe, aud
rough bauter are its constituents. Had Plautus ventured to
serve up to his hearers the fine productioris of Menander iu
their original delicacy, they would not have tolerated thc at-
tempt. That hc was capable of such higher efforts, however,
is shown by some ol his plays. Guizot well calls them the
“ aristocraey of his writings,” and by these we ought to judgc
his genius But they were not the popular plays iu Rome.
