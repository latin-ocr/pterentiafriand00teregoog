xvi INTRODUCTION. ,

tracus of his own writing, and by freely rehaudling his origi·
nals and adding broad touches of his own succeeded in pro·
ducing plays to which his audiences would listen. Ina later
and morc refined generation Horace (Ars Poetica, 270) tried
to look with disdain both ou his strong mother wit and his
imperfect metres:

“At vestri procui Plautinos et numeros ct
Laudarere sales3 nimium patienter utrumque,
Ne dicam stulte, mirati.'‘

But this harsh judgment of Horace, who is loath to acknowl·

edgc either his own obligations to his Italian predecessors
in poetry, or their intrinsic excellence, was not accepted by
antiquity or in later times.

The importance 61 Plautus is linguistic as well as literary.
He used the Latin language as none before him had done,
and when he had finished his labors it had advanced bya
great stride towards its classical stage. His masterly carc·
lessness, that ceclepean'a which Terence praises, is not to
be confounded with slovenliness or indifference 16 modes of

a fruitful inventiveness constantly directs it towards 6 great·
er organic unity without stripping it in any wise of its na-
tive vigor.

His metrcs are those of the Greek comedy, and their yokc
he attempts to impose on the rhythmically unordcred Latin
of his time. The loose and careless popular pronunciation
61 that age, when tho carefulness of classical pronunciation
was as yet unknown, made the moulding 61116 Latin lan-

pleted until a century after his death. Consequently his
verses do not move along with that facile readiness 61 pace .
which marks Greek poetry, but crowd and jostle unevenly in
their irregular aud hurried march 16 the step of the Greek
