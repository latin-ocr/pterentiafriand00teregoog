handed it in to the aediles in order to obtain their licensc,
he was invited to read it before Caecilius at dinner. As he
was dressed somewhat poorly, he began to read the “An-
dria” while sitting 011 a low bench at some distance from
the table. After he had read a few verses Caecilius was so

while and pursue his studies of Greek comcdy and life in
Greecc itself. According to one account he left Rome to

determination to surmount the criticisms and attacks of his
