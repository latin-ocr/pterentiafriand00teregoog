dience that those sitting in the ultima cavea, the backmost

scats, were apt to lose the words of any except the best
actore. The rows oi scats in the cavea were called gradus,
and the separate wedge-shaped sections embraced between
the radiating cross aisles were named cunei.

Before the time oi Terence seats were often partly or
wholly lacking, and the spectatore stood as they witnessed
the plays. The stage itself (σκηνή) was called the prosce-
nium or pulpitum, and its background, which contained the
fixed scene, was called the scaeua With Terence this is
regularly (except in the “Heauton timorumenos”) a street
scene in Athens. Three doors, at nearlyeqnal distanceS, faced
upon the stage. They were the doors of three houses. The
two houses on the left were usually immediately adjoining.
The third is placed at the right side of the stage. These
three face on the oia, or public street. Running back be-
tween them is an angiportum, or narrow street, which led to
the forum (the ἀγορά) near the AcropoliS, or else towards
the Piraeus, the seaport of Athens. On this main uia the
play was acted, and the various characters entered the stage
either from the house doors or by the angiportum. Occa-

as in the instance where Davus in the “Andria” runs around.
