Terence's plays were performed at the public gemes. The
“Andria” ιι1111111111,”“Η111101 timorumenos” aud “He-
cyra ” first appeared at the ludi Megalenses, held in the spring-

time in 11011101 Cybele. The “ Phormio ’' was brought out at
the ludi Romani, which were celebrated in September, and the

lamented the dubia fortuna scaenico by which the best efforts
