As the scene of Terence's plays is at Athens, so his dro-
mota'a personae are Athenian also. His unvarying theme is
the domestic life which was pictured in Menander. Each play
turns on the old but constantly new story of the antagonism
between the follies of youth and the severity of fathers.
The chief figures which appear are the severe and the easy-
going father, the openly wild youth and his companion
(sometimes a brother), who is supposed to be exemplary in
every way until events unmask him; the various sorts of
slaves, from the simple-minded and faithful to the crafty
seruos follae whose adroit stratagema often make him the
character of greatest interest, and the meretrix or courtesan.
Besides these we find the greedy parasite, the leno or pan-
der, the benevolent uncle, the long-lost daughter, and the
interesting ancillae, some of them light-headed and talk-
ative, and others sedate. Τὴε marrona, or mother, rarely
appears, but when she dosa, is invested with dignity and
gentleness, even if she is sometimes dull. One day ordi·
narily suffices for the events, whose happy issue is invari-
ably marriage and a general reconciliation. In the “ Andria,'’ ’
we spend a day at Athens from the morning, when the mar-
keting is brought home by the slaveS, to the noontime, when
the young men are loungiug idly in the foram, and on until
it grows dusk, and the time for celebrating the wedding has
come. lnthe “Heauton timorumenos’' the soene opens late in
the asterno'on. A night is supposed to elapse after the sec·
ond act. Τὴθ rest of the play begins with early morning at
the opening of the third act, and runs on until nearly evening.

Each play is divided into five acts, and each act, although
perfectly continuous in its movement, is composed of several
scenos. A new scene occurs whenever there is a partial
change of actors. For this the entrance or disappearance
