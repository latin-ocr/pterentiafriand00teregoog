of onc actor is sufficient. The principle on which the di·
vision into acts is effected needs fuller explanation, for it
is developed from a division inherited from the Greeks

The origin of the Greek tragio drama was in the chorus
sung in honor of the gods. In very early times this was
supplemented by the recitation of some actor, whose per-
formance was inserted between the songs of the chorus,
As the number of actors gradually increascd, tragedy arose
and filled the intervals between the music. It gradually
grew in importance until the music became a subsidiary part
and was employed to fill the intervals between the acting.
Thus there came to be a division into acts. Aristotle (Poet.
12) states that the acted parts of a tragedy were three; the
πρόλογος, or introducti0n; the ἐπεισόδιον, or plot3 and the
ἔξοδος, or dramatic de'oouemeot. To these he adds the χόρος,
or musical acoompaniment, which appeared prominently in
two places: namely‚ between the πρόλογος and ἐπεισόδιον and
between the ἐπεισόδιον and ἔξοδος. The ἐπεισόδιον itself was
afterwards gradually divided into parts by the insertion of
choral songs, the number of which was not regulated by rule.
However, a triple division prevailed in many tragedies, and
this when combined with the πρόλογος and ἔξοδος gave rise to
the tradition of five acts as the proper number for a drama.
The critios of Alexandria seem to have erected this into a
law for tragedy, and before the time of Horace it was a rec·

oguized rule for Latin comedy also. His statement in the
Ars Poetioa (lea-190) is

“ Neve minor nen sit quinto productior actu
Fabula, quae posci vult ct spectata reponi.”

This tradition of the Greek tragio drama did not pass at
once to comedy, although there is a statement by Euanthius,
whose authority is slight, that Menander wrote his comedies
divided into acts like tragedies but with the chorus omitted.
The earlier Latin comedies were performed as one eontin-
uous act, but the principle of interruptione was not wholly
