unknown, us is proved by the example of Plautus, who makes
a player say to the audiencc at a place in the aeting of tlie
Pseudolus (575) that the finteplayer is to entertnin them
during a pause in the actiug:

“ Tibicen uos interea hic delectaverit.'’

Terence seems to recognize a division of acts iu the sayiug
primo ectu placeo, which he puts into the mouth of Ambivius
Turpio in the prologue to the “ Hecyra.’' Donatus, however,
assures us that for the sake of holding his audiences with-
out the risk of wearyiug them by numerous pauses vult poeto
uester omues quicque octus velut uuum flevi. From this we
may conclude that Terence, even if he wrote his plays by
acta, did not venture to treat the acts ou the stage as sepa-
rated parts, except in rare instances* But whatever was
the measure of exactncss to which Terence adhercd, the di-
vision into five acts corresponds with the development of
the principal motives in each play. We may exclude the
prologue. This is nota πρόλογος at all, but a piece of lit·
erary polemio abounding in thrusts at his critica. Taking
the five acts which follow, their division is into the expositio
or first act, which mainly corresponds to the πρόλογος of the
Greeks, the involutio in the second, third, and fourth acta,
corresponding to the tripartite arrangement of the ἐπεισόδιον,
and thc evolutae, or ἔξοδος, in the fifth act. The expositio
contains the statement of the opening situation, tho involutio
the elaboraticn of the plot in three stages, and the evolutio
the conclusion. Each act, therefore, contains a leading mo·
tive which is worked out within its limite, and properes the
way for the treatment of the next.

The languagc of the plays of Terence is not that of the
later classical period, but of the next stage of advancement

⁸* The opening of the fourth act of the ‘⁶ Andria '’ was probably sung
to make o short break between thc third and fourth acts..
