ulter Plautus The development of the Latin language falls
into three periods. The first, or archaic, extends from the
'beginnings of Latin until the time of Plautus and his liter-
ary contemporaries, Naevius and the patriotic poet Ennius.
These three stand at the opening of the second or middle
period, which extends from Plautus to the age of Cicero, a
century and a half later. Tm third, or classical period, cx-
tends from Cicero onward through the age of Augustus, after
which the language begins to decline. In the archaic pe·
riod, Latin was the native language, which was growing up
carelessly in isolation from external influences. With the
middle period Greek influence begins to be felt, and gradu-
ally prunos away the excresceuces and irregularities of the
older time, and develops Latin in increasing conformity with
the Greek Itis a mixed process of discipline and cultiva-
tion. At the completiones this process the classica] period
begins For the understandiug of the history of the lan-
guage the middle period is of the highest value. It stands
midway, and receives into itself all the snrviving traces ol
the archaic period, aud develops iu itself, by anticipation,
the beginnings of the classical period, and in it alone are
to be seen in full operation the struggle of the native Latin
against its inevitable subjugation to Greek influeuees. Iu
this period Plautus stands at the beginning, aud from him
and his contemporaries was bequeathed to Terence the Latin
which had developed under their hands. It was Latin after
its first pruning under Greek influence. Terence received
it and carried the process still further. Under his treat-
ment many superfiuities and archa'ic expressions disappeared,
grammatical symmetry became more marked, the poetic
rhythms were somewhat more regular, and the way was bet·
ter cleared for the supremacy of the literary spirit of the
Greeks in Latin letters.
