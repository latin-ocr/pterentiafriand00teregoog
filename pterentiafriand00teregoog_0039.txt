basis for his diction, his eye is more definitely fixed ou the
Greek medela, and chiefly on Menander. What Naevius, Plau-
tus, and Ennius had done were for him the early triumphs
and memorials of the Latin drama fashioned according to
Greek ideals. But their efforts were not final in his eyes.

No matter how great his obligations 1ο these auctores, he
does not rest iu their style, but develops one which is his
own, aud on this side is his originality most clearly seen.
His style is the reflection of his own personal disposition.
Its marks are gentleuess, gracefulness, purity, and fine finish.
When the cultivation of letters became the fashion in Cice·

These two characterizations of the poet, by Cicero as soles
lecto sermone and by Caesar as peri sermonis amator, well ex-
pressed the judgment of cultivated Romans. He brought
into Latin that ‘urbanitas fer which we seek in vain in Plau-
tus. Latin letters were polite literature with him, without
a trace of the savagery of the old Roman spirit which lin-

his style is amere transcript. He is a more laborious artist,
and the clear simplieity of his original becomes under his
treatment something more ornamental. He is constantly Δ
