finer details the simpler lineaments of the Greek. One ex·
ample, out of a multitude, will illustrate this. Menander

writes, for example:

ὀργὴ φιλοῦντος μικρὸν ἰσχύει χρόνον.
“A lover's wrath lests but a little while.”

Terence rewrites thus:

“Amantium irae amoris integratiost”

‘⁴ Louers’ quarrels are love's renewal.'’

The lovers' quarrel in Menander is short. So also iu
Terence. But in the latter new and pleasing touches are
added-the change from ὀργή to irae and the expression iu
amoris integratio of the sequel of reconciliatiou, which is at

a form as Romans could appreciate, and without mutilation
or defscement. They are rewrought into dramas which em·
body more action and less dialogue. Two are sometimes
made into one by contaminatio, and such new touches added
and new characters created as are necessary to make the
literary product more perfect. Outside his style Terence
was creative only when it was necessary. Otherwise heis
imitative, partly and most obviously of the forms, but in a
far more important sense of the spirit of the Greeks. In
,later times the superiority of his style made him oue of the
poetic models. His imitatore were many. Petrarch, in the
fourteenth century, says that he who has never heard of
Terence and Plautus might as well confess that he had never
heard the name of poetry. “Quis enim, quaes0,'’ he writes,
“unquam pooetriae nomen absque illomm nominibus audivitl''
In the middle egesTerence continued to be taught as a poetic
model, as well as Vergil, and at the revival of learning in
the sixteenth century was edited ofteuer than any classic
author. Melanchthon, who, iu conjunction with Luther‚ laid
the foundations of educatiou ,for modern Germauy, speaks
