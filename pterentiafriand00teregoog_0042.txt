made lambio trimeter acatalectic, and four trochaic dipods,
of which the last was incomplete‚ made trochaic tetrameter
catalecti03 and so on. Taking the iambus (o -) and the
trochee (- υ) as fundamental fect, and combining them
into dipods as the units of seanning, it is also necessary to
notice that each dipod has a rhythmical or verse arcent,
which is a different thing from the ordinary word-accent,
and falls on the first heavy or socalled long syllable in each
dipod‚ thus:

υ .' υ - = inmble dipod with verse necent.
.'. υ - υ = trochalc dipod with verse secent.

These arethe accents printed in the text of the plays. By
combining the dipods, or metrieal neiis, into verses of differ-
ent length we obtain the various forms of iambio and tro-
ehaie metre. <

. The iambie and trochaic metres of Terence arc given bc·
low with their names derived from the Greek, and also their
Latin names, which are derived from the number of feet in-
stead of from the number of dipods

1. Iambic Trimeter Acatalectie, or lambio Senarius:

Ιυζυ-Ιυ-ὐ-Ιυ-ὐ;εΙ

This is the commonest measure in Terence, and contains fully
two thirds of all his iambis verses, or half of his comedies.
It serves for the ordinary and steady flow of the play.

2. Iambie Tetrameter Cataleetio, or Iambie septenarius:

lere-leze-lt.'e-lc.'=l

This consiste of seven full feet and the unacccnted light

beat of the eighth.
3. lambio Tetrameter Aeatalectie, or Iambic Octonarius:

Ινέυ-1υ.ὐ-Ιυ.ὐ-Ιυ.ὐκ1

Some shorter forms are also used, as the lambio Dimeter
(ν .’ υ - Ι υ L o -) or Quaternarius These are really frac-
. tions of verses, and are called clausulae both in iambic and
trochaie metra.
