xxxii INTRODUGTION.

The trochaic metres are two: ,
1. Trochaic Tetrameter Catalectic, or Trochaic Septena-
rius:

l-c-cl.'o-vl„'c-cl.'o=l

It consists of seven fect and the heavy syllable of the eighth.
Nearly all the trochaic verses in Terence are septenarii.
They are employed where dramatically important changes
occur, such as changes of scene, or in places where a more
stirring metre is needed than the quiet iambic senarius.
2. TrochaicTetrameterAcatalectic,orTrochaioOctonarius:

ch-cl.'c-vl.'c-vl.'c-vl

Besides these there is the Troohaic Dimeter Catalectic,
used as a clausula.

The other metres are so unusual as to need but brief men·
tion here. They are treated more, fully in the notes on the
passages where they occur. They are:

It might be supposed that with metres so simple as the
iambic and trochaic the scanning of Terence would be corn-
paratively easy. But such is not the case. The metros them-
selves are simple, but the language which is accommodated

‘ to them is the cause of the difficulties which arise. It is not

the fully developed Latin of Vergil and Horace, by whose
time the quantity of the separate syllables had attained a
fixed and definite value. It is the imperfectly developed and

carelessly pronounoed language of an earlier time, which is
undergoing the process of accommodatiori to the regularity
of Greek metres. The heavy and light beats of the metros
are by no means sure to coincide with the long and short
syllables on which they fall.
