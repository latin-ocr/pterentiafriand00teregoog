All the iambie and trochaic metres in Terence freely ad-
mit substitutos in every foot except the last. The most
common substitute is the spondeo, which may itself be re·
placed by other feet, such as the dactyl. Thus, ior exam-

The first te, of course, suffers elision as it would in scanning
Vergil or Horace. But of the seven feet of the verse only
three are iambis—namely, the second, the fourth, and the
seventh. All the others are spondees except the third,
modo* t', dat, which is the equivalent in length of a spondae.
In the first foot it is also noticeable that cmm is run together
as a monosyllable. But these spondees are not to be under-
stood in the same sense as spondees in Vergil, bnt as in-
stantes of careless heavy iambi, to whose rhythm the syl·
lables are but imperfectly accommodated in quantity, and
are to bc hurried along in scanning very much as regular
iambi. This is one of the simplest instanees, and exemplifies
a general tendency according to which the early Latin proso-
dy is regulated. It is the tendency to shorten originally long
unaccented voweIS, and obscure them in pronunciation. Simi-
larly, the wealrer vowel and consonant sounds generally suf·
iered to the extent of partial suppression, and sometimes
disappeared entirely, either by absorption in a neighboring
sound or by dropping altogether.

This tendency in Latin poetry will be more easily under-
stood when itis remembered that it is due to a general prin-

· ciple of language change. The principle is that the stronger

accented sound survives‚ and the weaker neighboring unae·
cented sound suffera. In this way, ior example, datm& in
the line cited above is run together as (ln‘me, the unaccented
t following the accented d being weckened, just as in the
hurried pronunciation of “ animal ” in English.

In this connection it is important to keep in view the
distinction between word-aceent and verse-accent. Word-
