aoeent is determined by the quantity of the syllables which
oompose the particular word. For example, fleri and modom
are aoeented on the antepenult and the penult respectively,
according to the laws of word-aooent. Verso-ament, 011 the
other hand, is the beat or stroke (ictus) of the metro, which
falls at regular intervals, and may either ooineide or confliot
with the word-aooent of the separate words which are ar·
rauged under the metro. Where the word-acoent and verse·
acuent coincide, there is no difficulty. Where they conflict,
however, it must be remembered that the verse-acoent pre-
vails. An example of this is soen in the soanning of a line
from the “Heauton timorumenos” (755):
eottldtdlnos sileri nee [fleri Ι modum
Here the verse-aooent coincides with the first fieri, and eon·
fliets with the second, ohanging it to fieri, and also makes
modam out of what otherwise would have been modom.
Examples of the weakening and running together of un-
aeoented sounds and of the oonfliot of word-aooent and verse-
acoent are not unoommon in the older English poetry‚ and
may be cited to help to a better understanding of similar
oecurrenoes in early Latin poetry.
The examples cited are all from iamhio verses
