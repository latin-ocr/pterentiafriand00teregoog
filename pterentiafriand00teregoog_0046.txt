INTRODUO'I'ION. XXXV

The following may also be quoted to illustrate the differ-
Ι ence between word and verse secent, although the old word-
accent may have been on the penult:

⁸⁴ Baulished thte frnil Ι captatelam hfl our flesh’'
(Shnk. ‘¹ Richurd ΙΙ.” i. 8).

“In a unuh, Ι an tuleicnt relceptdlcle'’
(slah, ‘⁴ Romeo und Juliet,” iv. 3).

3. Obscuring or dropping of weak, unacccntcd scunds:

(α) Obscuring-
“Is piel ty thus Ι aud pure Ι develtton paldh’
(¹‘Parndisc Loet,’' Bk. 11).
“Seeiug tot Ι much std Ι ncss nath Ι congealed Ι your bloed”
(Shak ‘⁶ Tnming ot the SltreW‚'‘'Inductlon 2).
“So spake Ι thc enlemy cf Ι mankind“
(⁸⁸ Pn1adisc Lost‚‘’ Bk. 9).

“suot ptr Ι allel th Ι the etrth Ι his deu ly ray“
Ι“ Paradise Lost‚‘' Bk. 5).

(b) Dropping-

“I'll not Ι be tied Ι to heure Ι nor ’pctntled times”

(shak. ‘⁶ Tuming ol the Shrew,'' iil. 1).
“Though retal friends Ι I b’lteve Ι are few'’

(Burns, “ Epistle to Laprsik‘').

“Thy tqlnmay Ι elcep with Ι thee 'in Ι thy βάνθ’
(Shak. “1 Heury IV.,’‘ u. 4).

“Ihoblal* to thiuklhtg and Ι indeed Ι the course

To wln the M001·agein”
(sunu. “ Othcllo‚’‘ li. 3).

“H0w‚ Ι Sir! thls qhztl’maa yhu Ι must hctr Ι ννίῐὶιέι1”
(Ben J onson, “Alcltemist,'’ i. 1).

Such examples as these illustrate in English the irregu-
larities thch abeund in the carelessly pronouneed popular
latin of the time of Terence. The instances in his plays
occur especially in certain definite combinaticus of syllables
cf which two can be stated in an exact formula.

⁴* “Probat is found in nll the early editions and is clearly a corruption
of probehle.‘' Guest's “Hist. English Rhythms,’' i. 54.
