xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

I. Ia tle comio ports u loay final syllable following] a short
aceenteel syllable could le slorteaeel. Tlot is, a word seleuse
natural quantity* e's represented by ό - may breomet c. This
instance of an accented syllable weakening its unaccented
neighbor may be seon 111 English in the altered values of e
and 11 in sepulchre and sepulchral. In the first instance the
unaccented a is feeblo, while the accented e gains in strength
by its accent. In the second, the converse is the case.

, Thus adeo becomes alud (Phorm. 972), tter becomes lelvt

(Hec. 312), and the dissyllabic imperatives ending in -ᾱ, -e,
or -1 have their final vowel shortened by the same principle.
Boye becomes rope, 111111 becomes itale, etat becomes edne,
and rede, real. This is very frequent. Occasionally we find
both forms side by side, as meret ardue (Heaut. 613). In
this connection it is to bo remembered that 111 Terence's
time the natural quantity of several vowelendings was dif-
ferent from their quantity in the classical period. Some
endings, which later were naturally short, in Terence are
often naturally long. These long endings are relics of still
earlier Latin quantity, and are much less frequent than in
Plautus. They point to a time at the beginning of the lan·
guage when endings were commonly of one quantity, and that
long. The principal relies of this archaia quantity in Ter-
ence are -ᾱ in the neuter plural, as in emata (Heaut. 575),
-rts in nom. sing, second declension, as filiils (Heaut. art),
-e in abl. sing, third declension, as tempore (Hes. 531), -eT in
pres. ind. endings of third conjugation, as accipit (Eun. 1082),
Similarly -ᾱ1 in the subjunctive, unyeelt (Ad. 25), -11 in the

perfect, stetit (Phorm. 9), ere in the pres. infin, as deterre
(And. 613) and dieue (And. 23). By the timo of classical
poetry these were regularly short.
