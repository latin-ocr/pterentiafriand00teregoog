table. Tbut ΝΝ, ιΙιΝ combinat ttoa L could be reduced to
,υ L. Exaniples of this are ebrae qri'olqaum (And. 760),
atet* ca Ilpa (Phorm. 987), ιᾰΝΝ {o (Eun. 489), cotue te belse
And. 403.

i This foim of reducing or ohscuring the sound·value of
syllables—namely, c - L to c υ L-might be still further
reduced or run together in actual scanning, so that υ vL
would have no more appreciable value than an iambus,
and may be represented as one, or in this approximate
form, WL, by lusing the two short syllables into one light
beat for scanning. Thus, the exemplarent pet—opacus (And.
’ 760), mentioned above, is partos an iambic senarius:

ΙΝΝΝΝιΝΝΝΝΙΝΝἵΝἴΝ quotquotve bc tsltbc telctsstsllbebl.

The general principle which is established by these two
classes is that the presence of verse-aceent* on a given syl-

ν lable tends to shorten the immediately neighboring unac-

cented syllables. The accentcd syllable is strengthened and
virtually lengthened at their expense.

ΙΙΙ. This reduction of quantity by the shrinkage of un-
accented vowels is not the only instance of mund-loss.
There was also at tendency to slur over or obscure the final
consonants of many words ,especiallyd,l, m, ΝΝ ,Ν,,ι tThis
will explain why a vowel rs not made long by position before

, two consonants,1n all cases where one of the two is obscured

or wholly dropped. The most numerous instances are those
connected with ΝΝΝ, Ν, Ν, ι, ol.

of cases in ΝΝΝ, we may cite enim in ΝΝόΝΝ euim dulcet ,where
the scanning becomes ΝΝόΝΝ )ΝΝΝΝ’ dulcet. So palrum ΝΝΝΝ prosit
becomes porro ΝΝΝΝ proisit. This rs the most common kind
of consonant atl dropping

Final r also suffers, as in pater ocait,=pute’ o έ)ΝΝΝἰ,· abror
dtcturt, color ΝΝΝΝΝΝΝ, and in other words.

'⁵ Whether coincidiug or conflicting with the word-accent. Thus, in
istoc both coincide, but in loro‘ they do not.
