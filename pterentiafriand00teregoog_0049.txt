xxxviii 1110000011011.

Final 0 was almost entirely suppresscd in common speech

· until tho time of Cicero. Thus, 0011100 eumzodlllo' 00110, ·

derfe'aleua eum=drffdsad aum, at the ending of iambic verses.

Final t seems to disappcar in verbendings in many in-
stanccs. Examples of this occur in the scanning of erit,
iubet, 00901, placet, studet, tacet, 00000100. So the combi-
nation at, when final, is thinncd in pronouncing in some
instanoes Thus, student fdcere obscures the whole syllable
001, and 101011οΠ1 fal is forced into shape as an iambus.

Final l vanishes from simul (Heaut. 803), and final 0110111
tameo (Ad. 145).

Some little words shrinlr, 00 ab to α’, ea to e’, and 111 to i',
like Shahospeare’s “a'' tho earth.'’

IV. The disregard 01 the effect of double consonante in
early Latin helped the tendcnoy to shorten syllables Thus,
ille} often :alla In per oppressionem, at the beginning of
Ad. 238, the 0 before pp is short, and the first foot is
petalam-'es

The instances thus far given apply principally to dissyl-
labic words, but may occur in any combinations of words
or syllables in which thesc metrical combinations of sylla-
bles (d-=do and o-.'=w.') occur.

V. Many words containing two successivo separate vowcls
fuse tho two into one. This is called synizesis Thus, deus
becomes dytis, lilre our “dauco’' So deo=dyo, and the dis-
syllabic forms of deus and deo commonly undergo synizesis
Besides these tho various forms of meua, 10000000, is, idem
ire, fuisse (and ui in the other perfect forms of 0000 gencr-
ally), 0100. Thus, eos=ycs 00011001;00011000,00010οε0000
fuisti=fwiati, duo:dwo (comparo our ιι1110”). Other in·
stances are dics, dtu, 0010, neeric, 010, ain (01000), ait, cibam,
trium, buius: 11100000, quoiuezquoiae.

Ii the preceding principles aro kept clearly in mind, it
noed not be difficult to read most of the metres of Terence.
The trouble is that nearly all of his verses contain more syl-

lables than arc necessary, and consequently the verse has to
