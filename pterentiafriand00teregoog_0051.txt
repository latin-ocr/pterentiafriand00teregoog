brief summaries of tho plot of each play. Perhaps about
300 an, may bo assigned as the time of Calliopius, of whom
scarcely anything is known beyond the fact that he reviscd
tho manuscripts, aud was long lookod back upon by later

copyists astho ultimate source from which they were to
transcribe new copies.

The later grammaticus are quite important, especially
DonatuS, who fiourished about 350 aa, and left a very
valuable commentary cn all the plays (that on the “Heauton
timorumenos'’ is now lost). About 400 nu. comes the
oldest extant manuscript of Terence, tho codex Bembiacs,
now in the Vatican at Rome. The other manuscripts of
value now known date from the eighth to the twelfth cen·
turies, and are copied from the older rocensiou of Calliopius,
which is lost. From these sources—the Bembiue and Cal-
hopian MSS. and the quotations in the grammarians-the
textor Terence is now derived.
