In this prologue the author answers two charges—first, that he
had appropriated his play srom Menander, tha Attia corncdian3
and, second, thatin doing thishe had also been guilty of contami-
aatr'o, or oi making orer two of Menander's plays, the Ἀνδρία
and Περινθία, into one play in Latin, thc “Andria’‘ He ansvvers
hoth these charges by adrnitting their truth, and justifies his
conduct by appealing to thc example of his greatest predecessore
in Latin poetry‚ Naevius, Plautus, and Ennius, who had repeat·
edly done the very things of which he was aceused.
