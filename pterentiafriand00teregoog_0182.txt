Heautontimorumenos uses moliantur in the sanie way· botlr of
Lavinius and his party. But for this controversy the very nanre

9. Andriam et Perinthiam, two lost plays of Menander.
About a dozen fragments of the Ἀνδρία and six or seven of the
Περινθία are preserved to us by quotation in otlrer writers. A
few correspondences are clearly traceable irr tlre Ἀνδρία, and one
iselear in the Περινθία (see note on v. 369), In addition to this
we know, on tlre authority of Donatus, that Act Ι. sc. 1 of Ter-
enoe's “Andria ” was taken from the Περινθία.

of tlre infinitiva is frequent in tlro cornio poets, and is to be sup·

connected with tao, the root of tany-o. Hence eoa-tamine is “to
