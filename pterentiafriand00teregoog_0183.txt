130 NOTES.

corttnmiantifecinere (B. G. Vtrae). Compare also Horace, Odes
I. 37. 9. The noun contaminatio is post-classical.

17. Faciuntne: ne for noerae is common in Terence. For the
sentiment of this verse compare the proverb of Menander, φρο-
νῶν atala φρονεῖ,

18. Naeuium Plautum Ennium: arranged in chronological
(anter. Naevius, hora 273 rac. (Bria), was one of the earliest
latin comedians and the first of any originality. He was a poet
of vigor, and of sonte genius. Besides writing an account of the
first Panic War in Saturnian verse, a native Latin metro, he
made imitatione of Greek plays, end attempted to impert into
Latin comedy the Athenian democratic freedom of comment on
the civil authorities and aristocratic families. For such arc-
flection on the powerful family of the Metelli he was cast into
prison, and escaped the danger of elcath, to which his offencc
legally exposed him, by going into exile. Neue of his successors
ever dared to imitate his example. It was the first and last in·
stance of the kind ander the republic. The severe stage censor-
ship exercised by the authorities, conpled with the example of
Naevius kept Latin comedy almost completely free from polit-
ical allusione. Plautus, born about 254 aa, was a younger con·
temporary of Naevius and the chief of Latin eomedians. He
ruled the cornio stage for a whole generation in his own life-
timc. Of his numerous plays only twenty have corne to us.
Terence took him as his principnl model on the Latin side, but
followed the Greek originals far more closely. Ennius, born
239 aa, was but slightly engaged with conredy, and mainly
with tragedy and epic poetry. He was deeply patriotic, and
was regarded with great reverence by the later Romans, as the
poet who penned the manante facta petrum, as his epitaph
written hy himself asserts. But even he was influenced hythe
Greeks, aad in his “ Iphigenia'’ uses the tragedy of Euripides as
his model, with occasional touches from Sophocles also.

Terence shows much skill in thus citing these three poets, who
represented the old Latin school which Lavinius thought should
bc copied, rather than have resort to the Greek or practice contami·
aare. Terence's unanswerahle answer is that he closely follows
the example of these fathers of Latin poetry, and so vindicates
himself and condemns Lavinius by that poct's own argument.
