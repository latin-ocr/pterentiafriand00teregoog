Acras Ι. Sc. 1.

This is the scene which Terence took from the Περινθία. Βο-
natas says primam scenam de Perinthia enee translatam, ehi aenea
ita cam neore loquitar at apud Terentiam eam liberto‚· thetis,
Terence takes the scene substantially, and probably literally
(tramlatam), but invents Sosia the libertae, and substitutas him
for the acor of the Περινθία. Donatus goes on to say in Andria
Menandri enlm aenae est,· an important remark, for it bears on
the similarity of the Ἀνδρία and Περινθία, and also on Terenee's
method of treating Menander, not merely hythe practice of eon·
terninano, as between whole plays, but by the rehendling of the
eontents of separate scenes as well. Menander had made the
first scene, both of his Ἀνδρία and Περινθία, out of the same plot,
with this diffcrence, that the former was a monologue and the
ethera dialogue. It is easy to see why Terence preferred the
Περινθία. It was because he was arlapting Menander to a Roman
audience, which was impatient of soliloquies, and to whom the
aelus aenea of the Ἀνδρία would have been intolerable through a
whole scene. Why Terence hanished the amr of the Περινθία
from this scene and invented Sosia instead is not entirely clear.
Certainly in this he displaycd that artistic nmbyenta'a (Prologus
20) which he claimed as his right, for Sosia is the merest soil used
sor the sake of dialogus, and never appears except in this scene.
Such a character was called by the Greeks πρόσωπον προτατικόν,
which is explained by Donatus as persona entre arpamentnm ar-
cessite, an actor who has nothing to do with the plot. Terence
invents such characters as he needs them, as in the Phormio and
Hecyra. For this he had the authority of Plautus.

This act contains the copositio or statement of the opening sit-
uation in the play and forecasts the plot. This was the original
