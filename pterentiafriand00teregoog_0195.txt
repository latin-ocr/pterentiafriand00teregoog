This scene is one of the few wherein we are afforded a glimpse
at some of Terence’s original composition, as distinguished from
his imitation. Although the Περινθίοὶο thesource efthe scene, yet
the character of Sosiaisevidently of Terenee’s own creation (see
introductory notes to tarascone). The poet has not simply struck
out the uem of the Repudia, and then repeated her language in
the mouth of Sosia Sosia’s language is totally unsuitable for an
asor or matrone in Terence, who always gives such a character
dignity, delicate sympat..y and tact, none of which appear in
Sosia. (Comp. Heaut, ActV, Pharna, Act V, Hec, Act lv„
Sc. 1, Ad, Aet ΠΙ.) Sosia is indeed a minor character, bat his
“ flat simplicity ” in themidis percantatio, which Cicero specified
as a feature to be admiratis a study from that slave-life with
which Terence· rvris familiar from his own experience.

¹Sosia's final disappearanee from the play immediately after hc
has been expressl y instrueted by Simo to take further part (169,
170) is, of course} a defect in the plot. But only in the plot, for
the introduction of Sosia adds incident and variety to what
would otherwise have been a long monologue.

- Some editors, among them Fleckeisen and Wagner, make the
first act end with the end of this first scene. N ο doubt the cepo
sitio strictly ends atthis point, and the plot really begins to wrwk
in the next scene. But Umpfenbach and most othere, following
Bentley, end thanet at 300. The break at 171 is more abrupt,
indeed, than in most scenas, aut not so great as the break need-
ful for dividing one act from another. Itis easily explained
when we remember that Terence was practicing contaminatio
here, so that it is not to bc expected that no marks of his joincry
show in such work, especially in his first play. It is also unde-
sirable to make a whole act out of one scene, as soenes are prop-

erly subdivisione of acts.
