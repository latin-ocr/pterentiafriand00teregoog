154 noras.

They form a secondary pair 01 characters answering to Pamphi·
lus and his slave Davus, and are introduced to fumish the side·
plot which Terence employs to enliven the dramatic action.
Charinus, toa, is in love, and has for an assistant his slave Byrria.
This side-plot is linked 10 the main plot, in which Pamphilus
and Davus are the central figures, by the circumstance that the
daughter 01 (11001000, whom Pamphilus is to he forced to marry,
is the one whom Charinus desines to marry. Pamphilus is being
forced to take a bride hc does not want, and Charinus, by the
same fact, to lose the bride he does want.

Although Terence creatas Byrria and Charinus, we are not to
suppose that he creates all the scenas in which they appear. In
fact we have proof to the contrary, for line 369 (where Charinus
is present) 10 almost the duplicate 01 τὸ παιδίον δ’ εἰσῆλθεν ἑψητοὺς
φέρον 10 Menander's Περινθίο. 11 10 interesting to notice how
Terence has woven in these new characters with what he took
from his Greek model. They appear in nearly all the scenos
01 the second act (which, we may noto, still retains traces of the
Περινθίο). 10 the third act they are entirely missing, which
seems to iudicate that the third act isbosed ou the Ἀνδρίο. 10
11ιο fourth act Charinus (without Byrria) is present in the first
two soenes, and never appears again until the last scene 01 the
play, in the fifth act. The fourth and fifth acts, as well as the
third, may thus be referred to 111οἈνδρίο, 0οᾱ probably entirely
so (except Charinus and the little that depends on him), for
nearly all the fragments 01 the Ἀνδρίο which match Terence's
“Andria ” fit passages in these last three acts, while all we know
of the Περινθίο, by fragments or from Donatus, has no application
beyond the first and second acts. Terence evidently made tho
Ἀνδρίο his basia, and wrought into its earlier part such passages
from the Περινθὶο 00 suited him. This is what hc means in the
prologue (13,14): in Andriam ea Perinthia satatnr transtulisse
(the first process) and atqua annm pro anis (the second process).
To this he adds certain inventione 01 his own, chief among them
the by-plot involving Charinus and Byrria, and a foll 10 Simo in
the person 01 Sosia. He then moulds the whole into one con·
sistent play, with a high degree of literary art, though not with·
out roncaliug here and there a seam or fissure in his work. Tho
play is no doubt Menander's by origination, but it is also Ter-
ence's by a sort 01 re-creation, for ha reworks his original into
something else which is not Menander, by a process (contaminatio,
