sion. This form occurs chiefly in words with t preceding the -ἱ,
Terence has also aduenti,fracti, quaesti. For others sce Roby‚
399. After tumulti Davus pauses an instant, and then, in order
to strengthen what he has just said, adds accessi to show hc aas
near enough to know whether there was any tumultus, and still
more intro aspect, proof enough that there was no decoration,
ornatus, anywhere inside. This is what Pamphilus refers to in
magnum dynam, “a capital proof.” His general conclusiomooa
opinor, Duce, is not'so unhcsitnting. narras, osten simply “ you
say.” See 434, 466, 970. Sometimes used in this sense in quoting
a single word, as herc and in 011. nil nimia. ΒΥ. “all'' narras

363. Α close imitation of a line in Menander's Περινθίο. See
introductory note to this act. The Greek is τὸ παιδίον δ’ εἰσῆλ-
θεν ἑψητοὺς φέρον. ἔψητοὶ ἐπὶτῶν λεπτῶν ἰχθυδίων is the defini·
tion given to ἑψητοί by Athenaeus, who preserves the line of
Menander. ἰχθύδιον exactly paralisis pisciculus. armazani-
aataa. Terence keeps close to his model here. Two points of
differencc, however, should he noticed. He adds οδοῑο to make
the old man’s cocao ridiculously cheap as well as scanty (a fine
meai, indeed, sor one who should he preparing to attend the
cocao nuptialia of his daughter instead Ι), and does not represent
the hoy as having entered (εἰσῆλθεν) the house. It might con·
fuse things to have Davus say accessi .· intro aspect, and then
have the boy find him in that situation. Hence abiens caracui.
ferro seems to he joined with conuerti, in spite of the awkward
grammar (comp. the analogous uideo ipsum egredi, Hec. 352; also
Heaut. 68, 69). No doubt it would be better as aa historical in·
finitive (: ferebat), but Terence hus made it rqrriralerrt to φέρον.
Ifhe had rendered εἰσῆλθεν literally we would liare little trouble
with ferre. Holcra, “herba” “ greens‚'’ “saled'‘ seni, reserved

370. Τδο absurdity of such a supper for Otreraea is all the
proof Charinus needs to make him happy. There will he no
wedding of Pamphilus with his Philumena. He leaps at once
to the desired conclusion liberatus sam. But Davus quickly
shows him his fallacy (372). Ac nullus quidem, a very strong
