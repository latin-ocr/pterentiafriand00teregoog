NOTES.

So. 4.

Simo enters from tho left-haud side of the stage, not by the
street which ran back on the right towards tho ferum. He
had disappeared by this street when he left the stage (205) to
seek Pamphilus. He reached the ferum, and, as he was pass·
ing through it (praeteriere, 253), met his son and ordered hirn
humeto prepare for his wedding. After reflecting carefuliy in
some out-ofthe·way place on what- further pians to adopt, he
returns circuitously 1ο the stage to demand Pamphilus's answer.

406. meditatuS, “ p1·epared.” He bas studied his part, com·
mitted it carefully. Oornp. aereas tecum meditere maeres (Hor.
Bp. 11. 2, 76) and qaia eut ta fere diceret, eut meditaretur estre
forero (Cic. Brut. 88, 302). So Plautus (Tria. 817) emaque hue
... meditatum prebe mittem.

408. proin tu fac apud te ut sies, brief, vigorous words of
exhortatiou. apud te, “yourself.” Comp. uie aum opud rae,

409. Modo ut possim, “if onlyI can.'’ medo ut, mate, and ert
medeare used in the sense “if oniy’‘ in wishes. So ert aude
fiant (Phorm. 711) aud medo eebree (Cic. Att. 11. 23). hoc an·
ticipates 410, 411.

So. 5.

412. Byrria steais back to the stage by order of Charinus,
who thinks Pamphilus will bear watching in spite ο1 his protes-
tations (332).

414. iu propterea, “for this purpose, accordingly.” id:
ideo, a frequent construction after verbs of motion. Comp. id
prodeo (nun.1005); td nee ed te uenimus (Plaut.hfii.1158); e'd
buo reuerti (Plaut. Amph. 909). e'd refers 1ο ut seirent, and prep-
terea to the command of Charinus. huno uenientem, Simo,
who had entered thc stage but a moment· before (404).

415. Ipsum adeo, “the very man himself,’' spoken as Byrria
catches sight of Pamphilus standing by Davus. adeo intensifies
iprum, as in Greek -γε strengthens αὐτός. With personat pro-
nouns it marks a change from one person to another. As ipsum
involves eum or ittera understood, the contrast between aare
(414) and ipsam is obvious. hoc agam, “here's what I'll do,'’
as hc steps aside so as to escape observation.
