451. drachumis: drurhdma is the Latinized δραχμή. Τ111
slight sound-gap before the μ gare rise to afaintly pronounced
11 in the Latin word. Similarly we find a riguit developed in
transferring such words 11 τέχνη into techina, μνᾶ into mina.
We sometimes find, however, such words written in the MSS.
without the d or 1ς drachma or droomo, and techna (possibly

1111111111 a spoken form in the time of Plautus). The form maa
was not unknown. In aceordance with the view of Ritsohlthese
words 111 now written consistently in their full form.

100 drochumae =1 mina.

Ten droctrinae, “ten sliillingS‚’' 11 Davus’s apparently guileless
report of what Pamphilus gucssed as the scanty sum which
would cover all 1111 father could have spent. Davus hardly
ventures to suggest the obolo of 369, but the inference he puts
into Pamphilus's mouth in 452 is the same as be himself had
drawn before in 366.

ply anamahtjais), a sharp reassertion of 11111111 puros in 450.

In spito of the difficulties which attend the 1111111111 of this
place astho beginning of an act, I have decided to adlrere to
tho traditional division. The apparent necessity of dividing
every play of Terence into fivc acts is visihly inconsistent· with
the rulo that the dividing line for a new act <accurs only when
the stage is completely emptied of the actors. This is not the
case here, sor both Simo and Davus remain. Thero are but two
complete breaks in the play (301 and 820).
