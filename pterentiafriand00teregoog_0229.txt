Acras IV.

The opening of this act finds Davus defeated and Pamphilus
lu despair. His distress is increased hythe various complica-
tions which arise iu regard to Charinus, whom he has uuinten-
tionaily betrayed, aud ln regard to Glycerium, who now supposes
herself to be deserted. Davus, however, comes to the rescae with
a couuterpiot.

Sc. 1.

Charinus enters iu great agitation. He has heard from Byrria
(431) that Pamphilus had agreed to marry Chremes's daughter,
aud also that Chremes had given his consentio the marriage
(572, 573). lt is only too true, as he at first feared (328). Pam-
philus has played him false. As hc paces to and fro on the stage
he delivers himself of a passionatc characterizatiou of meu who
are shamelcssly seifish. This occuples the first fourteeu lines
(uas-638), and in these the metrical disturbance is more violent
than anywhere else in Terence. The passage consists of

a dactyiic (L o ν) tetrameter (625),

then nine cretio (L o -) tetrameters (aaa-634),
oue broken trochalc septenarius (6361),

one lambio quaternarius (636), and

two bacchiae (υ L .’) tetrameters (637, 638).

It is, in fact, a little rhythmicai tempest, which slowly subsides
as the scene proceeds. This quietlug-dowu begins as Charinus
turns to consider, in less excitement, just what he had better do,
sed qaid apum? (639). From here until 655 the metra wavers
between trochaic septenarii (639, 646, 643-649) and lambio octo·
narii (641, 642, 656-654). From 655 onward it runs easily iu
lambio senarii to dila—almost to the end of the scene.
