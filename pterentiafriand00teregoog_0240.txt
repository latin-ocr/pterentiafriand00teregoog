800. Itan Chrysisi hemi “is it true about Chrysisl indeed 2¹³
111111, spoken sadly (91111111, Donatus) as Mysis nods assent. 11111
is sometimes placed aiter a question as apertiele of reiteration.
So DA. 11111 hercle 1111111190. 81. aon? hem? “noi don't you
indeed l” (194), and sl. 11111111 em? “nothingl do you sayl”
DA. 1111 morsus, “nothing at all ” (435). Crito delicately avoids‘
saying 1111111111 eat directly. 1101. . . miseras perdidit, in a
double sense. First, “afflicted us '² by her death, and, second,
“ruined us” because 01 the troubles which ensued after her
death in regard to Mysis's mistress, Glycerium. perdere, in the
sense of “ afflict,” is uucommon. An instance is found, however,
in Cicero (Pro. Rosc. Amer. 12. 33): amitaequae 01111111 eicie
pardhierit 11 adflata-tr. ¹

804. quo paeto hlei supply 11011111. sle, “s0,so.” Although
111010 be taken with the following 111, 1110 reasons against doing
so are very strong. eie is elsewhere used separately iu the sense
here indicated, as in aie, tenuiter (Phorm. 145). 111 is not part
of the necessary translation of the Greek proverb of which 805
is a duplicate. Finally‚ Donatus is against joining 111 with 111.
His comment is τὸ “ 111” nudum 111, 11 111 significatio 1019111111
cuiusdam 11 lenitudinis.

805. aiunt, 1* as they say”-parentlretical. Used to quote
proverbial sayiugs and generally in a fuller vray, as 111 quod 11111111
(Phorm. 500) and qaod 1111111 1Ρ1101111. 108). The line is almost
exactly Menander's ζῶμεν γὰρ οὐχ ὡς θέλομεν, ἀλλ’ ὡς δυνάμεθα
(Meineke, IV. 84). Caecilius, with whose poetry Terence was
well acquainted, has 1111101 ut poeria quando 11011 quie 111 111111.
Gonrp. also 305.

800. suos parentis: The 1111111111 amaa mercaturos 221, in
whose company Glycerium was shipwrecked when she was yet
very young, was not her father, 11111 her uncle (032). Hence she
has naturally hoped to find her parents living in Athens. Ter-
ence has skilfully veiled the fact up to this point by speaking
of her as 01111111 (224) in a vague way.

808. tetulissem, reeluplicated form of 111111111111. The only
other instance 111 Terence of the reduplicated perfect stem of
ferreis tetulit (832); both in his earliest play. In Plautus it is
quite frequent, tetulit being more common than 111111. Ηο also
has 1111111, tetulero, retulerit, and tetulisse. It is an old form which
is coufiued to tho poets, and dies out very soon after Plautus.
One instance is found in Lueretius.
