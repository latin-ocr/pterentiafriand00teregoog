198 werna

quality of these verses is not so finished as that os the play in
general, there is yet nothing necessarily inconsistent with the
supposition that it is the droit of an earlier ending which Ter-
ence abridged later. The settlement of Charinus's affairs is of
no sufficient dramatic valae to be spread out at length, and it
unnecessarily extends the play beyond the limits set by Menan-

der in his Ἀνδρία. Tlre shorter ending (err-981) may thus have
been substituted later by Terence himself. On the other hand,
we need to consider that ese-1002 have come down to us entire·
ly apert from the best extant l1SS.,that their text is corrupt in
many places and almost hopelessly so in 994, 995, that their lit-
erary valae is lower than the average of Terence, and that they
close in iambic senarii, whereas the regular ending of every play
in Terence is in treehaie septenarii. Accordingly Ritschl is of
the opinion that the second ending is the work of some poet a
little later than Terence. Dziatzko and Braun consider it much
later.
