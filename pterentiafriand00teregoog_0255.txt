'rue didascalia follows the arrangement 01 Dziatzko.

8. aduertite, MSS. and Priscian. Donatus has animadvertas
—Lepitaa et “ adtendite.'’ This latter is the reading in Umpfen-
bach.

103. The MSS. yield Quid igitur obstat, quor· non uerae
flant. This exceeds by one entire 1001 the proper length of the
verse. Either iya'tar or aerae should be excluded. Umpfenbach
excludes 1011001101Βο11110)1 and others exclude aerae.

171. It is hard to decide here between sequor and sequar.
Against Priscian’s reading and tho analogy os aequor elsewhere,

matical grounds Bentley alters the first part 01 the verse to aaa
iare aaa ace talaria, which makes the line sound in metre and
style, but is not deducible from the MSS, nor does it fit with the
comment of Donatus (100 proverbiale est) so well as Guyet’s con·
jecture qua iare qaoque talaria-a reproduction 01 the prover·
bial καὶ δικαίως κάδίκως ofthe Greeks.

224. fabulosi, Umpfenbach, on the ground that sabatae in the
MSS. is fadaia e=fal>ala eat, or solutast.
