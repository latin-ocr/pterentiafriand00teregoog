Bentley’s conjecture for huuc on the ground that it is absurd to ,
speak of Byrria as following Pamphilus. But hunc does not
refer to Pamphilus (see notes). If it did, Bentley's rejection of
the line would have inore substantial weight (sec notes). Mod-

· ern editors retain the line, although Wagner follows Bentley and
considers prepterea id (which he calls “a nasty pleonasm”) an> ’

additional reason for rejecting it. But see Spengel's “ Andria,'’
s. v. 414.

But in this line, where even Bentley could see no need of any

emendation, we may certainly retain et, in spiteof its infelicity,
