PROLOGVS.

This prologue, like the others 01 Terence, is occupied with
answering the attacks of his critica and in pleading ior a friend·
ly hearing. To accomplish both of these purposes the better
this prologue is intrusted to an old actor, probably Ambivius
Turpio, whose iufluence with the audience would naturally be
greater than that of any of the young and inexperieneed actors'
to whom the recitation 01 1110 prologue was ordinarily assigned. -
After a short introduction (1-9), in which tho double object 01
1110 speaker is stated in id primum dicum and deinde quod uerri
eloquar in v. 3, the remainder of the prologue is occupied with
the explanation 01 these two statements. Id primum diram is
unfolded in vv. 10-34 and deinde qaod uerti in vv. 35-52. (For
the critical difficulties in vv. 6 and 7-9, see the textual notes to
this play). The metre of the prologus (as in all the other prol·
ogues 01 Terence) is the iambic senarius.

2. Poeta: See note on Andr.

3. Id refers to the clause perr. . . adulescentiam. See note on
a‘d and Irae, And. 180. quod ueni :dr propter quod uerri or qaod
aeni ut dicerem. Not “why I came,” 101 then the subjunctive
ceperim would be required.

4. integra . . . integram, an entire Latin play taken from
one entire Greek play, without mixture of two Greek plays to
make one Latin (contaminatio ; see note on Andro). This is
,better than to translate intepet· in the sense oi “ fresh’' or “newly
adapted‚'’ because intepra is the technical contrast 10 0011101111-

aatu (Cic. Top. 18), and the natural adjective 10 use is 110110 (see ’

acaum decertandi, 7, and auae haee pleae eat pro noua, Heu. ὅ) 11
“ fresh'’ or “newly adopted ’² is meant.

(i. “Wrought out double from a single plot” in tlre Greek
original. This does not necessarily imply that Terence took
two Greek plays to make his one Latin eomedy. The better
interpretation is that he elaborated the simple plot 01 Menander
by adding a side-plot 01 his own. In so doing he doubled the
perronae 01 Menander, making two serica, two adulescentes, two
aerei, and two *amhae (Bacchis and Antiphila), instead of one.
