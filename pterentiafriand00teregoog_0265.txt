Aeros I. So. 1.

The opening situation. Menedemus, some three months be·
fore the time when the play begins, had been so serere with bis
only son Clinia as to (lrive him away from home. He now re-
grets his harshness and grieves for his son's prolonged absence,
and deprives himself of all the comforts of life in the meanwhile.
He has sold his house and bought a small farm near Athens,
where hc lives frugally and subjecte himself to hard labor. Hc
is the seli-tormenting father, the ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος from whom
the play is named.

The scene opens on the farm late in the asternoon. Menede-
mus, dressed in rough skins (as Varro states, De Re Rust. II. 11.
41), is at work. His neighbor, chremes, whose house is adjoin-

61, 62. pro deum atque hominnm fldem, a common expres-
sion (see And. 246), but fuller and suunger than pro deum fidem
(And. 237). quid uls tiuil See note on And. 375). The frag·

ment of Menandcr's Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενος, 011 which 61 and 62
are modelled, has been preserved-
