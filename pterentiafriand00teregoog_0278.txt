anything beyond the plainest clothing. Comp, for a similar
description, Pllorm. ros-107:

Nil aderat adiumenti ud pulchritddt'nem:

Capillus pascua oddae pes, lyrrso Ιιὸννίαἰα,

lacrumae, uestitus tarpis.
The impossibillty os essigning any regular construction to ease
has led to the belief that a line is missing. Accordingly a gap
is assumed after 289.

291. pax as an interjection scarcely occurs outsidc of Plautus
and Terence. ·1t means “peccel'' “enough 1³² “therei'' It is
used to enjoin silence (as herc on Clinia, who is about to spark),
or else to end a controversy. Ourirp. poc: nil amplius, 717.

292. conicias: Sec note on And. 602. mirere lo cameto
mean to put one suddenly into any new condition, whether good
or bed.

294, 295. The agreement of these lines with the correspond-
ing fragment of llIenander's Ἑαυτὸν τιμωρούμενοι is very close: ,

ἐξ ι’σταρίον δ’ ἐκρέματο φιλοπόνως πάνυ
...... καὶ θεραπαινὶς ἦν μία. ,
αὕτη συνύφαινε ῥυπαρῶς διακειμένη (hatneke, p. 844).

297. hano refers to theoocr'lluhr in 293. sordidatum ot sor·
didam, “ ragged, dirty girl '² (Colman). sordidatus refers to
dress, sordidus to the person.

298. dominam, “a lady;'’ spoken in a general way. Politen
on Syrus's part than amimae would have been.

909. denrunorarler: See end of note on And. 203.

991. adlectant uiam, ‘⁴ would make their way.'’

992, 999. nouam. . . inlre, lit. ‘⁴ to enter upon favor.” αανα
oefaham qratiam studeas inire may be rendered “don't try in a
false wey to gain favor from mc.'‘

aul-308. Syrus's narration changes to the present tense. It
is in natural response to the form of Clinia's excited question qaid
ott, ubi me omoioas. redisse. . . rogaro, “already returned‚’'
“now asked.” The graphio way in which these tenses stand in
contrest preparas us for the surprise and emotion of Antiphila.

aos.1toumnr: See note on 241. solbamzaciebum. See
note on aer·uiboa,A11d. 38.

919. uicissim: Clinia has had his turn with Syrus. It is now
Clitipho’s. illa altera, ‘⁶ that other woman” whom Syrus had
casually mentioned some time ago (271). Clitipho renews his
old question qaue uomet altera? (272) more emphatically.
