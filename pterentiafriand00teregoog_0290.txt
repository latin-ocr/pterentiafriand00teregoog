000. Pessuma: malo when applied to women osten means
'‘clarend’' or “ scheming.’'

600-606 contain the plan of Syrus, which he palms off 00010
master as a story 01100 business affairs of Bacchis. It is very
important to a clear apprehension of the remainder of the play
that the characters here mentioned be thoroughly distinguished
by the student.

601. huic is the ones 0001011110 (600). haec, Bacchis. Ι

602. lla, the 0000 Corinthia again. Her death isa skilful way
of getting rid of a possibly troublesome and unnecessary figure
in Syrus’s story. filiam, Antiphila.

600110, Antiphila; huic, Bacchis. This fictitious money
transactionis the basis 01 Syrus's plan: Bacchis had loaued
money to the 0000 Corinthio, who died without paying it back,
but gave her fllia adulescentula as security to Bacchiswho
might, 01 course, sell her as a slave and so get back her money.

604. 11000, Antiphila, seeum, Bacchis. apud uxorem, the
same person as tuom matrem (335). Itis Sostrata, 11110 01
Chremes and mother 01 Clitipho. 01 course Antiphila is at the ‚
house 01 Chremes. Why Syrus makes Antiphila seem more re-
spectable hy speaking of her residenee as with Sostrata, instead
of as at Chremes's house, is not yet disclosed, but comes out in
the next scene. Antiphila is to prove a long-lost daughter. ,

605, 606. sibi. . . illam, Bacchis. illi, Clinia. The second
part of Syrus's device (based on 603). Bacchis wants her mon-
ey 01 once (0000), and asks Clinia to obtain it. She will pay
him back afterwards, and meanwhile offers Antiphila as security.

606. mille nummum (znemmorum), the sum 01 money men-
tioned for the first time. It equals ten minoe, under which form
it appears later (724). itis the amount Syrus had secretly prom·
ised Bacchis if she should come and pretend to be (111010οι010-
tress. The sum is skilfully chosen. lt is· considerably smaller
than the price 01 00 ordinary slave (which in the eomic poeta
runs from twenty [see Adel. 191] up to sixty 011000 [comp. Plaut.
Most. Ι. 3. 1411), and hence Antiphila is ample security. But it
is also a large sum of money for a young man to be spend-
ing. Hence Chremes's amazement 10 et poscit quidem? “ 000
does, does she 1” Bacchis demands a good round snm, indeed.

601-600. Chremes does not come forward with the money as
Syrus had hoped, so he must say he meant to try Menedemus
