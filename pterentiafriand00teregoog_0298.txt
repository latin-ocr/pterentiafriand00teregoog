Acras IV.

The whole act is in iambic senarii.

So. 1 (iv. 5).

Chremes has learned that Clinia and Bacchis, with lrer numer-
ous attendants, have gone from his house over to the house of
Menedemus. He still thinks Bacchis is Clinia's mistress, and
pities old Menedemus for the new misfortunes in which his
abandoned and extravagant son is about to involve him.

Now follows the master-stroke of Syrus. He deceives Chremes
still further by telling him the truth about Bacchis and Clitipho,
as if it were Clinia's version of the facts told to Menedemus in
order to clear himself and persuade Menedemus that there was
now no obstacle to asking for Antiphila in marriage. Syrns'ex·
plains that this trick of Clinia's is to obtain Chremes's consent
to his marrying Antiphila, for the sake of getting money from
Menedemus (855, 856) for the wedding. This, of course, he will
spend on Bacchis. Chremes rejects this indignantly, us Syrus
expected, and also the proposal that hc should pretend to con-
sent to betroth Antiphila to Clinia. Then Syrus suggests that
Chremes, as a gentleman, will surely pay the ten err-lnce (zmilis
drachmarum, eor-603) his daughter virtually owes to Bacchis,
as 5 debt of honor. At last he agrees to this and to allow Cliti-
pho 50 take it to Bacchis, in order to help on Clinia's supposed
pretence to this extent anyway. Syrus is thus perfectly suc·
cessful.

759. Chremes's remark seems to be called forth by Syrus's
expression of anxiety to see him (757) and by the sudden de· ’
parture of Clinia and Bacchis with her servants to Menedemus's
house. Both of these he can explain only by supposing thet
Syrus has had some dealings with Menedemus. He is, of course,
mistaken.
