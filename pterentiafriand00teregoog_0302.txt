HEAVTON TIMORVMENOS, V. 1. 247

Acras V.

The preceding four acts have brought the play to a crisis. In
the first act, or expositio, Clinia’s love affairs furnish the opening
situation. The next three acts contain the involutio, or plot, in
which the main motive is the successful development of Cliti-
pho’s love affairs under cover of Clinia’s through the agency of
Syrus. Chremes, the father oi Clitipho, is a solt-confident man
prone to advise others, and tries to help out Menedemus, the
father of Clinia, by advising him to tolerate his son's behavior
without openly encouraging it. Menedemus readily consents,

Υ and Chremes advises Syrus to arrange whatever is necessary to

keep up the apparent deceit to be practised on Menedemus.
Syrus adroitly utilizes this so as to deceive Chremes (who is
ignorant of Clitipho's love affairs) in the very way in which
Chremes had urged him to deceive Menedemus.

'Phe fifth act, or evolutio, clears up the intricacies of the plot
by turning the tables on Chremes, who now ascertains the truth
about his own son. He who was so ready to advise ethera, so
wise and sagacious, is caught in his own net. The love affitirs
of Clitipho and Clinia are happily arranged, Clinia marrying

Antiphila, the daughter of Chremes, and Clitipho renouncing
Bacchis and taking a wife. As a last step Syrus is forgiven.

So. 1.

Menedemus has learned the truth about Clitipho. He com-
munientes it to Chremes who is astounded aad enraged beyond
all measure, and resolves to disinherit his son and inflict exem-
plary punishment on Syrus. The scene opens in trochaic sep·
tonarii (874-907), changes suddenly to iambie senarii as the
truth about Clitipho flashes upon Chremes (eoa-939), and re·
turns to trochaic septenarii for the rest of the scene (eto-954).

875. adintor . . . monitor. . . praemonstrator, “helpen”
“ prompte1·,” “ director,” appear to be terms of theatrical mean-
ing. Chremes had taken such complete charge of Menedemus
that the latter had only acted the part assigned him.

877. plumbeus, ‘tleadeu·head.”

879. Chremes steps out of his house reproving Sostrata with-
in, because other endless exclamatione of joy over her newly
found daughter.
