219. meust, Umpfenbach‚ following Fleckeisen. An unnec·
essary emendation. The MSS. read MEUS, and feeit may bc
understood, as Dziatzko suggests.

228. reatest without ‘ ’‚ Umpfenbaeh.

232. multae opiniones quae mihi animum exaugeant in all
the MSS. Bentley attacked this reading on two grounds—first,
that monpne animani applies only to expressions of joy, and,
second, that opiniones is nonsense because there was only oue
opinio, or “feeling” which Clinia entertained, aad that is ex·
pressed in nereos (231). Accordingly he rewrote the line
(“ ondader,” as he said) malta, opinionem hanc qnae inihi eninm.
Later editors have endeavored to be more moderate. But Bent-

3 ley’s argument rests onavery narrow arrayof instances. canapeia

is an exceedingly rare word, and even if no instance can he shown
of its applicatian to grief as well as joy, we have such iustanees
in the use of the simplerenpeo (compunges moerore, Plaut. Stich.
55) of which monpeo is merely an intensive. In regard to opins‘o
nes there is more difficulty. Its natural meaning is “opinions'’
But inultae opiniones is clearly connected with and explained by
its appositivas enumerated in amasio, mens, octos, mater (233).
From this connection there is no escape except in slaughtering
the text, and Bentley saw this as clearly as any one. But is
there not some meaning for opiniones which is suitahlc to its
appositivesl “Impressions,” κ1(10111,”01 even “ suspicions” (sce
Cael. in Cic. Ep. Fam. 8. 10. 2) have authority, though outside of
Terence. The separate instanccs out of which these opiniones
arise are given in the appositives. Translata “so many suspi-
cions conspire to torment my mind3—there’s her opportunities,
the place, her youth, ete.”

238. [‘lum’], Umpfenbach‚

239. Umpfenbaeh does not print any indication of the gap
after this line. See other note 011 289.

290. CAPILLUSPEXUS‚ A.

237. I have transferred Umpfenbach’s i aiter Scin to the end
of theverse.

300. disciplina est eisdem munerarier, Umpfenbach‚ with
preponderance of MSS. eis demuue1·aricr is Fleckeiscn's con-
jecture, with some MS. support. It avoids the awkwardness
of eadem, which had been noticed from before Bentley’s time.

353. Ridiculum esi, Umpfenbach‚
